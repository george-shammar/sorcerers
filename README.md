## Whitepaper

Please see the [Whitepaper](https://getinsignia.gitbook.io/whitepaper/) for details like the Game Play, Game Economy, Technicals, The Problem, Our Solution e.t.c

## Summary Of The Problem  :rage: :rage: :rage:
Below are some of the problems we have identified through research as the major pain points  of the Play-To-Earn/NFT gaming industry

- Weak or no element of enjoyable gaming due to emphasis on earning.
- Unsustainable game economic models.
- Weak Tokenomics or incompatible with the project model.


## Our Solution :smile: :smile: :smile:

- The ethos of Insignia is fun! We're creating a game with an immersive experience that you would love to play and spend time with even if there were no earning opportunity to it.
- The game economy is designed with sustainability in mind using a Rewards Reserve and Vault Pool.
